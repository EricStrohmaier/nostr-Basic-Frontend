thoughts about project:
nostrHub.co
nostWork.net


sounds like pornhub accutally hahah ther could be a section that i would be happy to sell the domain 
(you could see who is a active nostr user   trusted user)
(what links they post? their lists?)


nostWork.net => 

a client that is more for producing instead of consuming 
creater client? 

what it should be able to do?
 - having maybe a block system where you cant acces the feed   like setting a schleude for yourself
 - focusing on creating some links for creating a fanbase or etc`?
 - long and short format content   seeing popular hashtags?
 - having a feed where you can say extra yes?  adding them to the feed list (only your followers?) 
 - seeing no likes on posts  no zaps but the options are there   and no follower buttons ....

start where? 
build basic simple ui for all the functionality  mokup? [find design  color theme? ok => ]
learn how to connect to relays and how basic create delete like send stats functions work 
i need for this client all the basic client functions like 
commenting,
liking,
eatured names, 
etch hashtags, 
follow button unfollow button,
edit relays?,
edit profile?,
build user profile(less discracting?)

displaying the feed/schleudeing the feed? how will that work?

creating communitys? what about brodcasting your tweets?

creating the feed list=> witch feed do you want to see choose carefull? build a list of followers and then add to list or remove from list? 
posting long and short form content ? an option ? posting in my groups or brodcasting or regular post ?



if user first time? then send small interductiion to this client? is it possible?
